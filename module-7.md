Inputs

- Capital Expenditures (CapEx) – One-time investments required to start operations:

      - Equipment purchases – Cost of machines and tools.
      - Installation & infrastructure – Expenses for setting up the factory and utilities.
      - Initial setup costs – Any other upfront costs before production begins.

- Operational Expenditures (OpEx) – Recurring costs of running the factory:

      - Energy – Electricity or fuel consumption costs.
      - Labor – Wages for operators, engineers, and staff involved in production.
      - Maintenance & consumables – Regular servicing, spare parts, and materials.

- Production assumptions – Estimates needed for financial projections:

      - Volume / units per period – Expected production output over time.
      - Lifetime of machines – Used to spread costs across production.

- Pricing assumptions – Product or service prices used to calculate revenues.

Core Calculations

- Total CapEx & OpEx – Sum of all capital and operational expenses.
- Revenue projections – Estimated income from selling products/services.
- Profit & loss estimation – Expected financial results over time.
- Break-even point – When revenue covers all costs.
- ROI (Return on Investment) – Profitability relative to initial investment.
- Payback period – Time required to recover initial investment.
- Cash flow over 3–5 years – Predicted money inflows and outflows for financial planning.
